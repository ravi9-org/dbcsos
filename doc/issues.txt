---------
1)When I created the below test template it gave me the test brand I previously created to choose from so working well for that
[Ravi]: Working fine
2)I understand you are currently working on the badges so they will be ready on Monday right?
[Ravi]: Fixed.
3)Nothing happened when I hit save?
[Ravi]: Fixed along the way.

Slide 2:
--------
1) Nothing happened when click send
[Ravi]: Lux has to provide the REST API details to send the form.

Slide 3:
--------
1)Link breaks when clicking on edit
[Ravi]: cannot reproduce.
2)QR not working
[Ravi]: Showing the qr code from REST API's response as it is. Lux has to validate it.

[Ravi]: Waiting for the bg image from Lux :-)

Slide 5:
--------
1) Logos overlapping the name

Slide 6:
--------
1) Although I followed the steps for the Outlook windows one, the signature appears with a black background on my email � same for both QR and picture versions
[Ravi]: Not able to repro this on web outlook. Need to verify with Lux


Slide 7:
--------
1) What is that meant to be for?
[Ravi]: Fixed, removed notification (bell icon) from header.
2) Currently when clicking on the two existing template nothing happens. I assume moving forward when clicking on it should open the option to edit these existing ones?
[Ravi]: Edit templates are not yet done. Will do once REST API's are available by Lux.
3)This links currently to a random page � can you link it to our website homepage pls?
[Ravi]: Fixed, navigating to landing page.

[Ravi]: yes png files are transparent by it's nature.

Slide 10:
---------
No issues mentioned.

Slide 11:
---------
1)When selecting a user nothing happen. I would expect for an �Edit� or �modify� option to show so that the admin is able to update user info
[Ravi]: Users editing is not yet started, will do once REST API support is available by Lux.

2)Not urgent at all but can we order them in alphabetical order pls?
[Ravi]: Fixed.

Slide 12:
---------
1)I tried to create a test user but nothing happened when clicking save. Also as an expected behaviour 
once the user created is he/she supposed to received a notification email with the link and password to login? 
Also would that work the same way when we load the pilot users as bulk upload
[Ravi]: Fixed at front-end. Backed email communication is an REST API impediment, Lux has to look into this.

Slide 13:
---------
1)I tried to create a test office, filled in all the fields and hit save, the row appears but empty and info doesn�t display. Also is it ok for me to proceed of the bult upload?
[Ravi]: REST API issue, successfully data has sent to backend, upon success not getting the expected response. Lux has to look into this.

Slide 14:
---------
1)When selecting a badge nothing happen. I would expect for an �Edit� or �modify� option to show so that the admin is able to update user info

[Ravi]: Working fine, however there is an issue whiel showing the newly added item in table, fixed now.

[Ravi]: Lux has to educate the enduser :-)
