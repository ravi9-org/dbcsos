[Ravi]: Fixed.
3)Nothing happened when I hit save?
[Ravi]: Fixed along the way.

Slide 2:
--------
1) Nothing happened when click send
[Ravi]: Lux has to provide the REST API details to send the form.

Slide 3:
--------
1)Link breaks when clicking on edit
[Ravi]: cannot reproduce.
2)QR not working
[Ravi]: Showing the qr code from REST API's response as it is. Lux has to validate it.

[Ravi]: Not able to repro this on web outlook. Need to verify with Lux


Slide 7:
--------
1) What is that meant to be for?
[Ravi]: Fixed, removed notification (bell icon) from header.
2) Currently when clicking on the two existing template nothing happens. I assume moving forward when clicking on it should open the option to edit these existing ones?

[Ravi]: yes png files are transparent by it's nature.

Slide 10:

Slide 11:
---------

[Ravi]: Users editing is not yet started, will do once REST API support is available by Lux.

2)Not urgent at all but can we order them in alphabetical order pls?
[Ravi]: Fixed.

Slide 12:
---------
1)I tried to create a test user but nothing happened when clicking save. Also as an expected behaviour 
once the user created is he/she supposed to received a notification email with the link and password to login? 
Also would that work the same way when we load the pilot users as bulk upload
[Ravi]: Fixed at front-end. Backed email communication is an REST API impediment, Lux has to look into this.

Slide 13:
---------
1)I tried to create a test office, filled in all the fields and hit save, the row appears but empty and info doesn�t display. Also is it ok for me to proceed of the bult upload?
[Ravi]: REST API issue, successfully data has sent to backend, upon success not getting the expected response. Lux has to look into this.

[Ravi]: Working fine, however there is an issue whiel showing the newly added item in table, fixed now.
