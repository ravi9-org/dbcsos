Slide 1:
---------
1)When I created the below test template it gave me the test brand I previously created to choose from so working well for that
[Ravi]: Working fine
2)I understand you are currently working on the badges so they will be ready on Monday right?
[Ravi]: Fixed.
3)Nothing happened when I hit save?
[Ravi]: Fixed along the way.

Slide 2:
--------
1) Nothing happened when click send
[Ravi]: Lux has to provide the REST API details to send the form.

Slide 3:
--------
1)Link breaks when clicking on edit
[Ravi]: cannot reproduce.
2)QR not working
[Ravi]: Showing the qr code from REST API's response as it is. Lux has to validate it.

Slide 4:
--------
1) Understand you are currently working on fixing the background and adding the two download and share functionalities
[Ravi]: Waiting for the bg image from Lux :-)

Slide 5:
--------
1) Logos overlapping the name
[Ravi]: Fixed.

Slide 6:
--------
1) Although I followed the steps for the Outlook windows one, the signature appears with a black background on my email � same for both QR and picture versions
[Ravi]: Not able to repro this on web outlook. Need to verify with Lux


Slide 7:
--------
1) What is that meant to be for?
[Ravi]: Fixed, removed notification (bell icon) from header.
2) Currently when clicking on the two existing template nothing happens. I assume moving forward when clicking on it should open the option to edit these existing ones?
[Ravi]: Edit templates are not yet done. Will do once REST API's are available by Lux.
3)This links currently to a random page � can you link it to our website homepage pls?
[Ravi]: Fixed, navigating to landing page.

[Ravi]: yes png files are transparent by it's nature.

Slide 10:
---------

Slide 11:
---------
1)When selecting a user nothing happen. I would expect for an �Edit� or �modify� option to show so that the admin is able to update user info

2)Not urgent at all but can we order them in alphabetical order pls?
[Ravi]: Fixed.

Slide 12:
---------
1)I tried to create a test user but nothing happened when clicking save. Also as an expected behaviour 
once the user created is he/she supposed to received a notification email with the link and password to login? 
Also would that work the same way when we load the pilot users as bulk upload
[Ravi]: Fixed at front-end. Backed email communication is an REST API impediment, Lux has to look into this.

Slide 13:
---------
1)I tried to create a test office, filled in all the fields and hit save, the row appears but empty and info doesn�t display. Also is it ok for me to proceed of the bult upload?
[Ravi]: REST API issue, successfully data has sent to backend, upon success not getting the expected response. Lux has to look into this.

Slide 14:

[Ravi]: Working fine, however there is an issue whiel showing the newly added item in table, fixed now.

Issues- 2nd December 2022

27. The icons display on the web card is missing. [[FIXED]]
28. On Signature/cards pages, the name is taken from the current user name rather 
from the card user name. [[FIXED]]


29) Signature:
It looks like the black background issue when implementing the signature in outlook is back. 
It was working well when I tested for Laurent’s asset’s and mine over the week end but now 
showing again the black background. Can you please help fixing it asap?
-> need a config to reproduce it. last two days we fixed one issue in this area, ie., issue number (27).  [[Fixed]]

30) Save contact functionality:
On the web view of the card, where testing the save contact functionality is works as expected 
on desktop and mobile with android however Cherry who as an iphone is getting the attached code 
screenshot when trying through IOS, can you please fix that?
-> What needs to fix it? What is the format for IOS saved card, sample vcf would help here to fix it.

31) Badges:
I cannot see the second linked badge available, right not only the company fixed linkedin
is an option to choose from, can you please add Phone secondary number.
-> for secondary phone number, allow to remove numbers except the first one.
-> Fixed at UI side if there is any multiple fields exists, except the first one, remaining fields
even though those are configured as default can be removable. [[FIXED]]


32) Bulk upload:
We will be having the onboading session with the pilot users on Wednesday and I plan to load 
them in the system prior the session, can you please load both spreadsheets in there. 
On sake of time, I would prefer you to do to ensure no error occurs.
-> Laks has to take care of it.
 

33) Cherry’s account:
Cherry (cc’d) was able to receive the usual reset password email and login in her account. 
She can access the card tab and start create the card but when she hit save 
nothing happens (similar to the issue I had initially on my side) and then for the signature 
tab when she clicks on it, it keeps loading but not showing anything.
-> Laks has to take care of it.
 

34) Address:
Currently the zip code showing in the different offices addresses has a weird 
formatting with a “.0” at the end, can you please remove that?
-> I see in the address table, the data which added (might be thr' bulk upload) that excel sheet
should have integers instead-of decimals for zip (by default excel decimal column adds ".0" at the end)
Laks has to take care of it.

35) Friendly id:
We will specify to the pilot user that for now their friendly if must be unique 
and short to ensure it works properly but can we please look at expanding the server 
to prevent and issue happening in future? @Cherryseth and @Syazlina – Just confirmed 
with Lak on this one for the instruction to give to the pilot users on the onboading 
session on Wednesday, length will not really matter but they must input unique id and 
no special character (space if considered as special ones and this hence explained 
the issue I had for Laurent’s one initially)
-> Laks has to take care of it.
 
36) Picture:
Right now only people who are having a mouse can zoom in and out to adjust the picture 
on their card, can you please implement the + and – button on it. 
Also when trying to resize the focus circle the circle doesn’t maintain the ratio.
-> Will fix it. [[FIXED]]

Secondary bugs to fix (these can be fixed next week while the pilot has started):

37) When trying to login late night, giving bad credentials error – check the server to improve
-> Lux has to fix it at backend

38) Change the scroll on the web view from the card to the page
-> Duplicate of (11) item and already fixed. [[FIEXED]]

39) On the web view, make the share contact functionality work
-> will enhance it. [[FIXED]]

40) On the card view in the platform, make the “Send card” under the email option work (screenshot below)
-> Duplicate of (12), yet to fix.

41) Make the offices addresses not appearing italic
-> Intenionally given. As customer is not liking it removed just now. [[FIXED]]

42) Currently the picture of the web view (globe and ribbon) look blurry can we fix it?
-> Duplicate of (4), will fix it.

43) On the card background
The logo looks close to the edge and I expect that Kai would comment on it, 
if you let me know the current image background you use for it, happy to tweak it so the logo 
shows applying the correct exclusion zone around 
-> need more information on this.

44) On the signature (both QR and text options)
The International SOS logo showing on the dark blue rectangle should be the no tagline 
version instead, let me know which format of the no tagline you will need and I will provide it to you.
-> It will be fixed once new logo has uploaded to those cards, nothing to fix from UI side.

45) Include wechat badges (personal and company)
-> Laks can fix it.

46) Shorten URLs
[Ravi]: remove http(s)://www., font size to 14px

47) Ability to move the mandatory fields
[Ravi]: check the fesibility to shuffle fields while editing card
